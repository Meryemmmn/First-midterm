# TASK4

## 1. Challenges Faced During the Exam and how i resolved

During this exam, I encountered several challenges, especially when trying to implement some topics that were unfamiliar. Some of the challenges included:

- **Understanding md files:** md files were unfamiliear type of file for me, i was unsure how we can create and how it was used, i asked chatgpt
- **JavaDoc:** this was also new for me and i had hard times on creating one and again i asked chatgpt but i still am not sure if it was the correct way to do that.

## 2. When AI was helpful
- **creting javadoc:** i did not know how to use tags and class-level documentation, it was really helpful. I understood and used the code with tags that it helped me with
- **md files:** it helped me to understand why we use md files and how it should be used 
- **new feature:** also in task3, i was unsure about what i can make the new feature and AI helped me with the idea of search feature and in implementation of it.

## 3. When AI was not helpful
To be honest, it was helpful for me thoughout the exam. I believe with the right prompt, you can get your desired answer from chatgpt, but still there is a chance that it can give you wrong answers, so it is better to double check and that was exactly what i did. While using AI it is important not to fully rely on it solely.
